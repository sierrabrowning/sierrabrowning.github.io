<h1>THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD</h1> <hr/>

<p><img class="tsm" src="thescientificmethod.jpg" alt="Scientific Method Art"/></p>

<p class="left-align">The scientific method is a logical process detailing steps that serve as a guideline for scientists so that they know how to perform experiments. 
There are a few basic steps in the scientific method that outline the best way for experimentation to be conducted. When used correctly, the 
scientific method will result in more accurate outcomes than other methods.</p>

<h3>OBSERVATION</h3>

<p class="left-align">The first step is observation. You must identify the thing you wish to research and conduct experiments on. Decide on a specific question that you 
want to ask and find an answer to. Begin with: "How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where?" 
(http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml). Then you have your topic of inquiry for the development of 
your hypothesis.</p> 

<h3>HYPOTHESIS</h3>

<p class="left-align">The second step of the scientific method is to formulate a hypothesis. A hypothesis is defined as "a possible solution to a problem, based on 
knowledge and research "(http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/scientific_method.html). After observing a topic, you decide how you think something works. 
It is basically a prediction or educated guess of what your findings will be at the end of your experimentation. For example, "if __________,  then 
__________". An "if, then" statement can be a helpful tool to formulating your hypothesis.</p>

<h3>CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT</h3>

<p class="left-align">The experiment is then conducted based upon your hypothesis. As part of the scientific method, your next step is to design a test that indicates 
whether your hypothesis has any accuracy to it. This experiment should be well controlled and designed to provide you with the best data in the end. 
It should also be unbiased. Make sure that your own opinion of what the outcome should be does not cloud your data.</p>

<h3>ANALYZE YOUR DATA</h3>

<p class="left-align">As you conduct your experiment, record the data discovered. Make sure the outcomes are recorded accurately. This step includes analyzing the data you 
obtained from your experiment to precisely indicate a conclusion.</p>

<h3>CONCLUDE</h3>

<p class="left-align">Lastly, come to a conclusion about whether your hypothesis was correct after reviewing the data from your experiment. Once again, do not let your own
 bias influence how you conclude. Calmly and scientifically decided whether your hypothesis was proved true or false (based upon your resulting data).</p>
