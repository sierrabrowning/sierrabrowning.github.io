<h1>CANCER CELLS</h1><hr/>
<h2>Cell Division Gone Wrong</h2>

<p class="left-align">How do regular functioning cells become cancer cells? There are signals within the normal cell cycle (mitosis) that either inhibit or promote 
cell division. When these signals are balanced, the cell will copy its DNA and split at a healthy rate, replacing dead cells with new ones.</p>

<p class="left-align" >In the case of cancer, a mutation has occurred that interrupts this usual cycle and causes the cells to split rapidly. 
This hastened process causes there to be exponentially more cells in an area than there should be.
The chemical signals that inhibit or promote cell division are sent from neighboring cells to each other. This allows the cells to know 
when to begin the process of mitosis and split into two new daughter cells.</p>

</p>
<p class="left-align" >There are two genes that are in charge of sending the inhibiting or promoting signals. These are called proto-onco genes and tumor suppressor genes.
 The proto-onco gene stimulates division while the tumor suppressor gene slows or stops cell division when activated. 
 When a mutation occurs in the regular DNA, a proto-onco gene can act as an accelerator to cell division. It would be like having your gas pedal stuck
 to the floor. Likewise, a mutation in the tumor-suppressor gene would be like having defective breaks. It would no longer be effective at inhibiting 
 cell division. As the number of cancerous cells increase after a mutation, a tumor can develop if the process is not stopped. A cancer cell from the
 tumor can also enter the blood stream and develop tumors elsewhere in the body. This process is called metastasis.</p>
 
<p class="left-align" >There is a chance to stop this dangerous cycle. "Medicines that are used to treat cancer are sometimes aimed at killing cells that are rapidly
 dividing by mitosis. They inhibit the synthesis or function of DNA - this type of treatment is called chemotherapy." 
 (http://www.abpischools.org.uk/page/modules/celldiv_cancer/cancer4.cfm).
Basically, cancer cell division is when the usual cell division of mitosis is sped up. Our body has processes set in place through the proto-onco 
and tumor suppressor genes to keep cell division in check. When this process goes awry, we have the potential to be facing unwanted cell growth in
 the form of cancer.</p>
